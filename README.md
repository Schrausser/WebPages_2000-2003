Section of Differential Psychology (2000-2003)**

*The section of Differential Psychology deals with the following research topics:  
The study of physiological correlates of human intelligence. In our own EEG laboratory high-definition EEG with up to 64 channels is used to study spatio-temporal patterns of cortical activation during performance of cognitive tasks and compare these patterns between individuals with different levels of psychometric intelligence.
The development of a battery of tests for 'Emotional Intelligence'.
The investigation of elementary cognitive correlates of human intelligence.*

**Projects**  

1. Intelligence and neural efficiency
This project supported by a grant from the 'Fonds zur Foerderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung' - FWF - in Austria (No P13461) aims at a comprehensive inquiry into the physiological bases of human intelligence. In a series of experiments we study the influence of several factors that possibly determine the relations between intellectual ability and the spatial patterns of cortical activation during cognitive performance: (1) The influence of ECT-specificity or content (verbal vs. numerical vs. figural); (2) The relation of learning ability (known to be related to psychometric intelligence) to cortical activation. (3) The effects of the ECT complexity; (4) The spatial distribution of cortical activation during working memory tasks known to correlate substantially with psychometric intelligence test performance. Additionally, in cooperation with Elsbeth Stern (Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin) we intend to analyze the relationship between expertise, intelligence and cortical activation patterns. |publications|
2. Speed of information processing and learning ability
The relation of speed of information processing to the concept of learning ability is investigated in a cooperation with Juergen Guthke and Jens Beckmann (University of Leipzig) in the framework of the university partnership Leipzig-Graz. |publications|

3. Emotional Intelligence
In recent years the concept of Emotional Intelligence has received an increasing interest in the popular psychological literatur. However, to date, this popular concept is not reflected in academic psychological research. A prerequisite for psychological research on this topic as well as for the application in the context of applied psychology is the availability of psychological tests for Emotional Intelligence. Currently we are taking first steps towards the development of a test battery for Emotional Intelligence. As the term Emotional Intelligence implies it should be an ability construct not a personality trait. Therefore, our focus is on the development of performance tests and not on self-report questionnaires although such measures are being developed in this project too.
